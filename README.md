Audi uses audio signals to transfer data.
Not meant for speed or anything, just an experiment.

##Current state

Currently binning the output levels in four values and playing data by encoding to base 4 (Kind of Amplitude shift keying). Results at reception aren't good (basically, not working), might be having tiny mistake somewhere either in code or transmission stuff.
